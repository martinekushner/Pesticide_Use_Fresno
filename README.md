Environmental Justice at the Urban-Agricultural Interface: Pesticide Use and Cumulative Burdens in Fresno, CA

Fresno is one of the top Agricultural producing counties in the U.S. and is a major part of the California Central Valley agricultural economy, which produces ¼ of the country’s food. The valley’s topography coupled with land use and air quality policy, distributional inequities, and discriminatory siting have, over time, led to the exposure of low-income families and small BIPOC farmers to pesticide drift and other cumulative air quality and environmental burdens. 
Exposure to pesticides through the air has been linked to a number of serious health conditions. Section 12972 of the California Food and Agriculture Code requires that any pesticide application take necessary precautions to prevent substantial drift to nontarget areas. However, community members have expressed that the County of Fresno and the state of California have failed to adequately enforce this, and it is disproportionately harming farmworkers and their families and residents living near pesticide spraying farms. As one of the most polluted regions in the nation, residents of the San Joaquin Valley are burdened by the cumulative effects of many drivers of pollution. 



This analysis uses the Department of Pesticide Regulation's  2021 Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) data set and the Deartment of Education's school locations to show the proximity between the application of dangerous pesticides and schools. Children are especially vulnerable to the health impacts of pesticides, and , and CalEnviroScreen 4.0

Farmworkers and their families are especially exposed to pesticides. The bivariate maps below show pesticide use correlated with charecteristics common in farmworker communities in the Central Valley. Many of these characteristics also serve as barriers to reporting, which is the main way the County Agricultural Commisioners find out about pesticide drift instances.
